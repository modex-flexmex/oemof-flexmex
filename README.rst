oemoflex is sector-integrated multi-node energy system model featuring a lot of flexibility options.
Its region, interconnections and components can be adapted flexibly.

The model has been developed in the context of the model comparison project FlexMex and builds upon the open energy modeling framework _oemof_.
Oemoflex defines a data format to run energy system optimization using oemof.solph and oemof.tabular. It provides pre- and postprocessing routines
to feed the project's harmonized input data into the model and transform the output data into the output data template.
